<h1>Welcome to Hangman!</h1>

Hangman is a simple game where players must guess a hidden word by entering in letters. For each incorrect guess, a
portion of a man being hanged is drawn.

<h2>About the Game</h2>

A word is randomly chosen from an existing list of words and is shown to the player obscured. The player then guesses a
letter they think might be in the word when prompted. If the letter exists in the word, it is revealed to the player in
the corresponding spots. If the letter does not exist, a portion of a stick figure being hanged is drawn.

<h2>Winning the Game</h2>

The goal of the game is guess every letter in the hidden word. The player wins if they are able to guess all of the
letters in the word. If the player makes too many wrong guesses, the stick figure is drawn and the game ends.
